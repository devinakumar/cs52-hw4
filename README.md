# Redux Blog
This repository uses React-Redux to build the client side of a blog with functionality for viewing posts, creating new posts, and deleting posts.  The blog allows for markdown rendering.  The posts are stored on an api server running at https://devinacs52hw5p2.herokuapp.com/api.  This app uses Axios to make promise-based requests to the server.  What worked well was making functions that did one specific thing; for example, in the show component, making functions for each separate field allowed me to specialize the fields that I edited.  Another thing that worked well was mapping state to props, because it was an efficient way for all of the components to have access to the master map.  One thing that did not work very well was accessing the parameters.  One problem that I had was reconfiguring the app to render the username.  I had to figure out how to access the variables from the back-end.  Another challenge was figuring out how to authenticate new posts; we had to wrap the component in a wrapper function.  One thing that worked well was creating new components for each separate action--sign in, sign out, sign up--instead of combining them in one, because it allowed me to make each one have its own special design.
